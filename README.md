# Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX

## Overview
This project implements a custom ERC20 token contract named `vpqToken`. The contract allows users to create, mint, burn, and transfer tokens. It includes features for managing ownership, enabling the transfer of contract ownership to another account securely. The contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and integrates OpenZeppelin's Ownable module to restrict access to administrative functions like minting.
